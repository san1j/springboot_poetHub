And down underneath is the loveliest nook,

One leaf is for hope, and one is for faith,

And God put another in for luck—

Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question…
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit.','The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock',3,2);
